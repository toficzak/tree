# Dynamic Programming

Think: fibonacci in recursive manner

Approaches:
- top-down (memoization) - mostly reccursive
	- dictionary keeping already computed results
	- ease of implementation
	- speed (sparse subproblems table)
- bottom-up (tabulation) - mostly iterative
	- iterative counting from subproblem to main problem
	- all cases must be counted
	- speed (dense subproblem table)
	- no risk of call stack overflow
	- possibility of space optimization

base case - simpliest case, I know the answer to this one
