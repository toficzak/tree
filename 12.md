# Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

directed acyclic graph (DAG):
- directed
- no cycles

graph:
- directed (one direction)
- undirected (vertexes are bidirectional)

DAG is helpful structure, it's basically splitting problem to subproblems.

DAG pluses:
- checks if any overlapping subproblems
- what subproblems am I solving
- dimensions of the dp table
- what are dependencies (other subproblems) for given subproblem
